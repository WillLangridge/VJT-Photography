      <h3>Where it all Started</h3>
        <p>
          Looking through the lens all started off as a hobby in school, where i attended photography club learning my camera as a basic.
          However over the years I wanted to change my artistic eye, skills and knowledge from basic to professional, going from a hobby to a career I would love, helping others capturing the memories with my shutter button

          <h3>My Interests</h3>
            <p>
              I can capture a beautiful landscape to the urban culture.
              However I do enjoy capturing the love in a family-new-born, the strength in a relationship and the bond between humans and animals.
              Every memory is unique and personal, my career path would be family shoots, weddings and child's photography.
